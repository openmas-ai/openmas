# Welcome to OpenMAS

**OpenMAS** is a Pythonic ecosystem designed to simplify the development, structuring, integration, and deployment of asynchronous Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). It provides a lightweight **framework**, a standardized project structure, and helpful CLI tooling to let you focus on agent logic rather than boilerplate.

Inspired by modern development ecosystems and driven by real-world use cases like `chesspal.ai`, OpenMAS aims to streamline the entire MAS lifecycle, with particular attention to integrating communication protocols like the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** alongside standard web protocols.

## Key Features

* **Simplified Agent Development:** Build agents inheriting from `BaseAgent` with a clear asynchronous lifecycle (`setup`, `run`, `shutdown`).
* **Flexible Communication:** Pluggable communicators for HTTP, Model Context Protocol (SSE & Stdio), gRPC, MQTT, with **lazy loading** to keep dependencies minimal. Easily extend with custom communicators.
* **Workflow Implementation:** Implement various agent interaction patterns (see [Building Effective AI Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents)). Specific helpers are available for the [Orchestrator-Worker pattern](patterns.md), and the core framework enables building custom workflows like **prompt chaining, routing, and parallel execution**, with more helpers planned for future releases. See [Agent Patterns](patterns.md).
* **Structured Projects:** Standardized directory layout (`agents/`, `shared/`, `extensions/`, `packages/`) generated by `openmas init` promotes modularity and maintainability. See [Project Structure](project_structure.md).
* **Project Scaffolding:** Uses a conventional structure that promotes modularity and maintainability. See [Project Structure](project_structure.md).
* **Configuration System:** Layered from project defaults, environment-specific settings, `.env`, and environment variables. See [Configuration Guide](guides/configuration.md).
* **LLM Integration:** Provides tools for agents with language model reasoning mechanisms. Follow guides for [LLM Integration](guides/llm_integration.md) (using official LLM client libraries like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini) or explore built-in support for [BDI Patterns](guides/reasoning_integration.md) (including `Belief` objects, Intentions, Plans, and extensible reasoning methods).
* **CLI Tools:** Streamlines development with commands like `openmas init`, `openmas run`, `openmas validate` (`openmas generate-dockerfile`, `openmas generate-compose`). See [CLI Docs](cli/index.md).
* **Extensibility:** Design encourages local project extensions (`extensions/`) and shareable external packages (`packages/`).
* **Testing Utilities:** Includes `MockCommunicator` and `AgentTestHarness` to facilitate unit and integration testing. See [Testing Utilities Guide](guides/testing-utilities.md).
